        <p style="color:red; font-size: larger;" >Asfour Rent A Car was established in mid 2020, under a trade license issued by Sharjah Municipality.
            At the onset of business in September 2020, the company had a total of only 6 cars which was increased to 13 cars in January 2021.  By 2022, sufficient business was being carried out to accommodate 45 cars in total.  The company has continued to expand its customer portfolio to such an extent that business necessities we now have a car fleet of over 300 cars of various models, commercial vehicles and passenger buses.
            We state with confidencee that Asfour Rent A Car in the year 2023 had become one of the most leading and respected car rental firms in the UAE, which was due to an increasing demand from customers who recognized that our service was conducted in  a highly professional manneer and our rates with the competetive rates to offer.
            In January 1990, Speed Rent A Car decided to open the now fully equipped Speed Auto Workshop employing  highly silld workforce, under a separate trade license which serves to support tha car rental trae, as well as gaining business through dealing directly with members of the public and insurance companies.  The workshop greatly reduces the car rental maintenance, rapair and insurance evaluations for the company fleet, which priviously had proved exorbitant.
            As the company is thriving to a progress, we have now or group of companies interlinked with each other such as Asfour Travel & Tours, Asfour Cleaning and Al Gubaiba Filling Station & Car Wash to boost not only our car rental company but the tourism business as well.
